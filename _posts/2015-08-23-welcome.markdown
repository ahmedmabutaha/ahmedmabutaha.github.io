I created this website because my endless digital circles need a way to come together. I’m creating an internet hub where all the things that I’ve done, am doing, and want to do can live.

I don’t just want this site to be about me; I want to share what i love, what I’m interested in, with you.

I think of the web as One Big Warm Fuzzy just waiting to happen. Because I’ve seen it time and time again, and I love nothing more than being the person who makes that happen.

So, let’s talk. Let’s get a glass of coffee or two, and talk about that huge idea or project or goal you’ve got on your mind. Let’s brainstorm over brunch and leave full of eggs benny and delicious new plans. Let’s Skype about that massive hurdle standing in your way… with a side of interwebby gossip thrown in for good measure.

Sound good? Great. Talk soon!
